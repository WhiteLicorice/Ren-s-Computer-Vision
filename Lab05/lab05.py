    Description:
        1. Read https://medium.com/@paulsonpremsingh7/image-stitching-using-opencv-a-step-by-step-tutorial-9214aa4255ec

    2. Using the code in 1) as basis, stitch the images from a directory named 'data'.

    3. Using the video named 'spike.mp4' in directory 'data', generate an actionshot image. 
    Actionshot is a method of capturing an object in action and displaying it in a single image with multiple sequential appearances of the object.
    Extra credits for using your own video for the actionshot image.
    (doing the cartwheel, running forehand in tennis, grand jet√© in ballet, somersault in acrobatics or diving, forward flip in skateboarding)
    SAFETY FIRST. Be sure you know what you are doing should you embark in this adventure.
    
    The testing suite can be accessed in lab05.py and the stitching functions should be accessed via stitching.py.
